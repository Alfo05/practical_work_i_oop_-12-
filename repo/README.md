### 3.2 SUMMARY OF THE DOCUMENT 



## 4. DESCRIPTION 

### 4.1 PROPOSED SOLUTION

### 4.2 CLASS DIAGRAM 

### 4.3 DEVELOPMENT COSIDERATIONS 

- The different considerations must be followed to develop the program:

- The simulator must include al least 2 runways for the airport.

- The program must implement comprehensive input validation to handle errors.

- It is not allowed to use functions like Environment.Exit(0) for ending the program. 

- It is not allowed to use break and continue statements in the loops. You should structure your loops and logic in a way that avoids their necessity, promoting clear and understandable code flow.

## 5. PROBLEMS & CHALLENGES

Creating repo correctly 

Enums 

Load from File 



## 6. CONCLUSIONS 

### 6.1 LESSONS LEARNED 

Powerness of enums, and lists 

### 6.2 EFFECTIVENESS 



### 6.3 INSIGHTS GAINED 

How to use enums

## 7. IMPORTANT NOTES 


It is possible that you see some files in the repository with the name of the repository being 6, this is because there was a problem with the group handling and its members and a new group had to be assigned and our 
group number was changed to 12. The repository was created when we were the group number 6.
